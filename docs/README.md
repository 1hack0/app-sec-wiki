**Application Security Wiki** is an initiative to provide all Application security related resources to Security Researchers and developers at one place. 

## Why App Sec Wiki ? 

For me, the main source of information I use to learn about recent vulnerabilities or trends in application security is usually:

* twitter 
* [/r/netsec](https://reddit.com/r/netsec)

I have been on twitter for the past 4 years. However, I now i feel like there are too many tweets or information to take in and most of the time, it is same kind of information. In short: **Information Overload**. Also, we miss out on most of the information/tips because new information keeps coming in.

With this wiki, I am trying to fix the aforementioned problem by:

* Listing out all existing unique resources(**quality > quantity**) related to every vulnerability type. 
* Providing a weekly newsletter of all new unique articles/tips/tricks/tweets.
* Will also update all information on the [appsecwiki](https://twitter.com/appsecwiki) Twitter Account. .

## How to use this wiki ?

Each type of vulnerability listed on this wiki is divided into the following four sections:

* **Learning**: It covers articles to learn about that vulnerability type. 
* **Writeups**: This wiki is about quality over quantity, so I have only included writeups that have something to teach other than what is already in the Learning section. 
* **Cheatsheets/Payloads**: It includes cheatsheets and payloads which can help when pentesting an application.
* **Tools**: Any tool related to the type of vulnerability that can help when pentesting an application.
